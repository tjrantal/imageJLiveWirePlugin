		<H2>ImageJ LiveWire plug-in for computer-assisted muscle compartment segmentation</H2>
		<p>
			An implementation of <a href="http://www.medicalimageanalysisjournal.com/article/S1361-8415%2897%2985005-0/abstract">Barrett & Mortensen 1997 live-wire boundary extraction paper</a>. Load a pre-compiled plug-in from <B><a href="plugin/ListenerPlugin_.jar">here</a></B>. The source code (including an ant build file) is available at <a href="https://github.com/tjrantal/imageJLiveWirePlugin">github</a>.

		<H2>Use</H2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open an image (if stack, browse to the image you want to segment)</li>
				<li>Fire up the plug-in: Plugins -> LiveWire. It is a good idea to tie the plug-in to a keyboard shortcut (Plugins->Shortcuts->Create Shortcut... and look for LiveWire from the alphabetically ordered list)</li>
				<li>Zoom in to make segmentation easier, and left click on a point to init segmentation</li>
				<li>Moving the cursor around shows the segmentation in real-time. Left click to a point to freeze the segmentation up to that point</li>
				<li>Press and hold the 'shift' key, and left click to add a straight line segment</li>
				<li>Press and hold the 'ctrl' key, to remove the latest segment added (it is possible to reverse all the way to the first point)</li>
				<li>Double left click finishes the segmentation. The first click of the double click is added as a point to the segmentation, and a straight line segment is added from that point to the first point (used to init the segmentation) to close the region of interest.<br><br>The roi is added to the RoiManager at this point</li>
				<li>You can segment multiple ROIs in a given image. Once you've finished with the final ROI of a given image press 'q' key to shutdown the plug-in. If you want to segment another image from the same stack, browse to that image, and restart teh plug-in. N.B. Switching images without shutting down the plug-in will lead into erroneous results!</li>
